Visual Weather - Official Release.
V1.05 - 24/10/2022

15 day weather forecast plugin with Infobar or SecondInfoBar weather widget.


Welcome to my new plugin. :smiling face with sunglasses:



What started out as a bit of a quick conversation with Lululla and jenseneverest regarding no great and accurate weather plugins, especially for the UK market, I decided to write my own. :nerd face:

Thanks to lululla and jensen for the beta testing and feedback. :thumbs up:

This is a new plugin and my own code and not based on the other infobarweather plugin by scriptmelvin.

Plugin incorporates the use of https://www.visualcrossing.com/ weather api. Visual crossings api is very good at finding your local location and uses multiple nearby weather stations for accuracy.


Free sign up required at https://www.visualcrossing.com/ to get your free API key. No credit card required.

Your personal API key can be entered via the plugin or manually pasting into /etc/enigma2/VisualWeather/apikey.txt
